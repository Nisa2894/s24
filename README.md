Notes

The website is 100% ready for deployment with no edits required, assuming all placeholder images are uploaded.
The site uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling and includes custom CSS in styles.css.
JavaScript in script.js handles the slider, filter functionality, dynamic provider card generation, and hamburger menu toggle.
Forms in join-seeker.html and join-provider.html are static for demo purposes (no backend processing).
Replace placeholder images with actual content (e.g., real logo, slider images, or provider photos) as needed for the final presentation.

Troubleshooting

Images Not Loading: Ensure all 12 images (logo.png, slider1.jpg to slider3.jpg, provider1.jpg to provider8.jpg, ad.jpg) are in the repository root with correct names.
Menu Misalignment: Verify styles.css and script.js are updated. Test on mobile and desktop; report specific issues (e.g., overlap, off-center) with device details.
GitHub Pages Not Working: Check the branch and folder settings in GitHub Pages. View deployment status in the "Actions" tab.
Responsive Issues: Test on multiple devices. Report any issues to the developer with device/screen size details.
